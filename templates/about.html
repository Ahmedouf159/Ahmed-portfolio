      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>
        I am Ahmed, a passionate young developer from Egypt. I started learning programming in 2024 and I enjoy building
        real software projects instead of only studying theory. I like backend development and creating useful apps that solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is my favorite language because it is powerful and flexible. I build web apps and tools using Python and I also work with
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and SQL. I’m interested in robotics and future technologies, and I hope to build intelligent systems one day.
